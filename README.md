- Generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for modeling behavior in model tails
- Extremal types theorem is like the central limit theory, but for maxima in a given period
- block sizes impact GEV distribution
- simulated a known distribution to model maximum based on distribution of order statistics to compare GEVs from different block sizes to the the true maxima using goodness of fit tests
